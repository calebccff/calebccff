## Hi, I'm caleb

I'm an embedded Linux dev. I spend a lot of my time working on [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org) for the [OnePlus 6](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/OnePlus_6_(oneplus-enchilada)) and a few other devices.

I work in most of the computer stack (with the exception of web :P), here are a some other projects:

* A CT head scan viewer for one of my university modules: https://github.com/calebccff/cthead-viewer
* Porting Linux to the ipod6g (iPod Classic): https://github.com/ipodclassic-mainline
* A 6502 emulator written in D (destined to become an NES emulator, but unfortunately that never happened): https://gitlab.com/calebccff/dnes
* A new 6502 emulator written in C++, applying everything I've learnt in the 3 years since dNES :D: https://git.sr.ht/~calebccff/cnes
* (WIP) An open source/OSHW PCB I designed to let you make a board farm out of phones: https://git.sr.ht/~calebccff/rptr-pcb
