## Hi, I'm caleb

I write code that solves problems, I mostly work on embedded Linux. I spend a lot of my time working on [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org) for the [OnePlus 6](https://github.com/calebccff/pmos-oneplus6) and a few other devices. I want to make phones usable beyond the manufacturers lifespan, and we're making that a reality.

Seriously, this stuff is so fricking cool!
