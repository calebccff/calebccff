## Hi, I'm caleb

I write code that solves problems, I mostly work on embedded Linux. I spend a lot of my time working on [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org) for the [OnePlus 6](https://github.com/calebccff/pmos-oneplus6) and a few other devices. I want to make phones usable beyond the manufacturers lifespan. I also work on whatever else takes my interest...

* A CT head scan viewer for one of my university modules: https://github.com/calebccff/cthead-viewer
* Porting Linux to the ipod6g (iPod Classic): https://github.com/ipodclassic-mainline
* A 6502 emulator written in D (destined to become an NES emulator, but unfortunately that never happened): https://gitlab.com/calebccff/dnes
* (WIP) An open source/OSHW PCB I designed to let you make a board farm out of phones: https://git.sr.ht/~calebccff/rptr-pcb
